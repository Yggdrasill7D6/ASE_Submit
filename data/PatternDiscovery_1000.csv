I'm building a custom input component which is essentially a regular input form element that has an attached character counter. That part works great.

I've written an example over on stackblitz (https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-yaupgp?file=src/app/app.component.html). It shows all my code and an example of my custom component along side a regular form input. Both should display the validation text below the input when clicking the submit button, but I can't seem to get my custom one to behave.  I'm sure it has something to do with when and how Angular checks for changes, or something with the lifecycle. I'm just not sure.

6333,appium,"Hey guys! I have a question around mounting an angular application with dynamic options. Typically angular applications are rendered by having a `app-root` element in the DOM when the bootstrap method is called, and it renders the angular application in the `app-root` element. I am thinking of a situation where I can call something similar to `render(AngularComponent, div)` which other frameworks like react and vue use. It's possible I don't need this though so I'll also explain my use case:  I want to be able to specify some options (e.g. from the server side), which I would use while initialising the app module. For example, configuring the StoreModule or the TranslateModule with the provided options. In a react app, these options could be passed to the component instance like `ReactDOM.render(<Component {...options} />, element)` when rendering.  Current workarounds I am using is creating these options in a global window variable before bootstrapping the app module, and retrieving them from the global variable within the application but this isn't ideal. The alternative option is to set the options in a module that holds a reference to the config, and retrieve the config from there as well. This is similar to the window global variable approach, but instead sets the data in a module.","T1: I want to be able to specify some options (e.g. from the server side), which I would use while initialising the app module",ETD_WANT_TO,1,"T2: Current workarounds I am using is creating these options in a global window variable before bootstrapping the app module, and retrieving them from the global variable within the application but this isn't ideal.","PS_NEG_AUX_ADV_ADJ,",1
