Please determine whether the given user input provides the information (so-called ETD) of the program's anticipated behavior or the user's expectation. This problem is divided into two steps.
1.Identify sentences describing the program's anticipated behavior or the user's expectation in detail, typically containing patterns such as 'trying/try/tried to do', 'want/wanted to do', 'need to do', 'would like to do', an interrogative sentence starting with any of the phrases 'how do I', 'how to', 'can I', 'is there a way to'. Sentences only describing the system error or undesired behavior should not be considered, such as 'any idea why...' or 'doesn't work'. Sentences missing details of anticipated behavior should also not be considered, such as 'please help me ...'.
(2) If found one or more sentences from (1), use triple quotes to cite the found sentences and return like this: "The sentence """insert found sentence here""" describes ETD. The answer is YES"; otherwise, return "No sentences found to indicate the user's expectation. The answer is NO".
