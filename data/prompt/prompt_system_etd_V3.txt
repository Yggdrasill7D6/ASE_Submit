Use the following step-by-step instructions to respond to user inputs.  
1.Identify sentences describing the program's anticipated behavior or the user's expectation in detail, typically containing patterns such as 'trying/try/tried to do', 'want/wanted to do', 'need to do', 'would like to do', an interrogative sentence starting with any of the phrases 'how do I', 'how to', 'can I', 'is there a way to'. Sentences only describing the system error or undesired behavior should not be considered, such as 'any idea why...' or 'doesn't work'. Sentences missing details of anticipated behavior should also not be considered, such as 'please help me ...'. If such sentences are found, proceed to Step 2. Otherwise, return 'No sentences found to indicate the user's expectation. The answer is NO.' 
2.Summarize the sentences into one or more patterns like 'trying to VB' using keywords and part-of-speech tags. Then explain why the found sentences contain patterns like 'trying to do' to describe the program's anticipated behavior or the user's expectation. 
3.Use the following format to respond to user inputs: The sentence """insert found sentence here""" uses <pattern>insert pattern here</pattern> to indicate ... The answer is YES.
