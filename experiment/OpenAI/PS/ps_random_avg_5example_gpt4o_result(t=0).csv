angular,"hey guys, got a weird one here. I'm using ng-select in my app, but it's used hundreds of times all over the place, so to make usage consistent and to make updating all of them easier, we made a wrapper component which has the ng-select inside it. It's mostly working very well, the only problem is with projected content. So ng-select supports projected content with `ng-option` elements, so you can do, e.g. this: [code]. This would allow options in the select list to have custom span inside them. But I cannot get this working in my wrapper. The template for the wrapper looks like: [code]. And from other templates I would use it like: [code]. I would expect projected content to be passed straight through to inner `ng-select`, but it's not working at all.

,"Hi all, I'm currently in the process of upgrading my project from version 6 to 12. My current setup is two repos: one with library projects and one with an app that consumes the libraries. The usual workflow is to watch for library code changes (e.g. `ng build @myLibs/foo --watch`) and make sure that the consumer app picks up the changes by running `ng build myApp --watch`. The link between them is made by running `npm link` in the libs dist folder and then `npm link @mylibs/foo` in the consumer app workspace. So far it worked perfectly in Angular 6 - the watcher on the consumer app picked up any changes to the linked library and recompiled a new bundle that reflected them.

This would allow options in the select list to have custom span inside them. But I cannot get this working in my wrapper. The template for the wrapper looks like: [code]. And from other templates I would use it like: [code]. I would expect projected content to be passed straight through to inner `ng-select`, but it's not working at all.

,"Hi all, I'm currently in the process of upgrading my project from version 6 to 12. My current setup is two repos: one with library projects and one with an app that consumes the libraries. The usual workflow is to watch for library code changes (e.g. `ng build @myLibs/foo --watch`) and make sure that the consumer app picks up the changes by running `ng build myApp --watch`. The link between them is made by running `npm link` in the libs dist folder and then `npm link @mylibs/foo` in the consumer app workspace. So far it worked perfectly in Angular 6 - the watcher on the consumer app picked up any changes to the linked library and recompiled a new bundle that reflected them. After upgrading to Angular 12, I can see that the watcher for the consumer app detects some changes as soon as the lib watcher finishes recompiling, but the changes are not reflected in the output bundle anymore.

We use ngFor to iterate over the entities and display each useras name and whether the user is an admin. Our next step is to create a reactive form presentation of our data. Since we work with a collection of entities, our best option would be to use a FormArray where each element in the array is a FormGroup that represents a single entity. how would you do it? itemized forms for the entire collection, or something fancy with pipes in the template, or something simple with databinding to item.current? please advise",No sentences found to indicate the error or undesired behavior.
